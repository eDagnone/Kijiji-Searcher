The power And rgb on it works, just some kind of issue posting. I’m guessing it may be have been a short circuit. I’m posting to see if anyone would be interested in buying, I’ve had it for 2 years only used to game lightly and general tasks, nothing serious. Hasn’t been used for mining. I tried to use it after a while and discovered this issue.
This card along with all other gpus have skyrocketed in price recently due to demand so if fixed this could be a decent deal for the right person as I’ve seen this variant selling for 600-800 and even higher on eBay.
Let me know if interested.","Mon Apr 19 2021 13:07:37 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)"
